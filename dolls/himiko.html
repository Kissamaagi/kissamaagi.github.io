    <h1>Himiko</h1>

    <p>
      My very first doll. She is named after the historical empress of Japan. Quite the dramatic name. She is a small demure gir
      , I like dressing her in very feminine, frilly fashion. Inspired by Olive magazine, Pink House clothes, vintage sleepwear
      etc.</br>
      Her body is very aged and her knees are quite loose. I'm thinking of changing it to OB22 or newer pureneemo one. I think a S sized body would fit her better, and that one seems to have more clothes as well.
