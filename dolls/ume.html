    <h1>Ume</h1>

    <p>
      A cheerful gyaru girl. She loves anything tropical. I got the parts for her when I was in Japan 2017-2018 and OB24 was new. It's a very nice body. Her first faceup was also the first I tried doing myself. Her second one is 2nd or 3rd, I did her new one and Himiko's touch ups at the same time.
